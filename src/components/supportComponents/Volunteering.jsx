          <p>HUHA is run largely by our team of incredible volunteers and we are always looking for new people to join our team.<br/><br/>

          Volunteering for HUHA can be a big commitment, but it is hugely rewarding too. Volunteer requirements:
          Note: some volunteer tasks require heavy lifting and agility and some shelter tasks can get very messy.<br/><br/>

          Throughout the year there will be opportunities to volunteer on a one-off basis at working bees, street appeals and other events. Follow us on Facebook and Instagram to keep up with all things HUHA.<br/><br/>
