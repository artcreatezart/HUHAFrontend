        <p>Fundraising is a great way to raise money for us and raise awareness at the same time. You could start a collection, throw a concert, talk to local businesses or make a stall - whatever interests you, and that you think would work well in your community.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Past fundraising events put on by the HUHA community include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a kick-a-thon and sports events</li>
            <li>discos and movie nights</li>
            <li>school event fundraisers</li>
            <li>local business fundraisers</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>If you are keen to get involved pleaseÂ contact us. We can let you know if there's a specific project or part of HUHA that we'd love you to raise funds for.</p>
